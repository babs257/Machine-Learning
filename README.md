## Projects

### 1. Customer Review Sentiment Analysis with Time-Series Tracking
**File:** `Customer_Review_Sentiment_NLP_TimeSeries.ipynb`

NLP pipeline for automated sentiment classification and topic modelling on real 
customer review data. Uses fine-tuned BERT for sentiment classification and 
BERTopic combined with LDA to surface recurring themes automatically. Includes 
time-series analysis tracking how sentiment shifts over time, enabling root-cause 
analysis of changing customer perceptions before and after product changes.

**Skills:** Python · NLP · BERT · BERTopic · LDA · Sentiment Analysis · 
Time-Series Analysis · Matplotlib · Plotly · pandas

### 2. Nando's Review Sentiment Analysis
**File:** `Nandos_Review_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb`

End-to-end sentiment analysis and temporal trend modelling applied to restaurant 
review data. Covers NLP preprocessing, model evaluation, and interactive 
visualisation of sentiment trends over time. Demonstrates the practical application 
of text classification on real-world unstructured data.

**Skills:** Python · NLP · Sentiment Analysis · Time-Series · Plotly · pandas · 
Text Preprocessing

### 3. Applied Machine Learning — Classification and Regression
**File:** `Applied_Machine_Learning_Classification_Regression.ipynb`

Comprehensive supervised learning project covering both classification and 
regression tasks. Includes feature engineering, cross-validation, hyperparameter 
tuning, and rigorous model evaluation using scikit-learn and XGBoost. Demonstrates 
a structured, methodical approach to building and comparing ML models on tabular 
data.

**Skills:** Python · scikit-learn · XGBoost · Feature Engineering · 
Cross-Validation · Hyperparameter Tuning · Model Evaluation · Matplotlib

### 4. Demand Forecasting — Time-Series Prediction
**File:** `Demand_Forecasting_TimeSeries.ipynb`

Time-series forecasting project predicting product demand using statistical and 
machine learning approaches. Covers stationarity testing, seasonal decomposition, 
and evaluation of forecast accuracy using standard metrics. Demonstrates practical 
forecasting methodology applicable to real business planning problems.

**Skills:** Python · Time-Series Forecasting · Statistical Modelling · pandas · 
Matplotlib · Forecast Evaluation

### 5. Survival Outcome Prediction — Random Forest Classification
**File:** `Survival_Prediction_RandomForest_Classification.ipynb`

Binary classification project predicting survival outcomes using a Random Forest 
classifier. Goes beyond basic modelling to include thoughtful feature engineering, 
hyperparameter tuning, and thorough model interpretation — feature importance 
analysis, confusion matrix evaluation, and ROC curve assessment. Demonstrates the 
kind of critical model interrogation needed when predictions have real consequences 
for individuals.

**Skills:** Python · scikit-learn · Random Forest · Feature Engineering · 
Classification · Model Interpretation · Feature Importance · ROC Curve · 
Confusion Matrix · Matplotlib

### 6. MSc Thesis — Stochastic Diffusion Search for Feature Selection in 
High-Dimensional Datasets
**File:** `MSc_Thesis_Stochastic_Diffusion_Search_Feature_Selection.ipynb`

Original academic research applying stochastic optimisation to the problem of 
feature selection in high-dimensional datasets. Proposes a novel agent-based search 
mechanism that identifies optimal feature subsets more effectively than traditional 
methods including recursive feature elimination and LASSO. Validated through 
rigorous experimental design across benchmark datasets, demonstrating improved 
model accuracy and reduced training time. Awarded Distinction as part of MSc Data 
Science at the University of Greenwich.

**Skills:** Python · Feature Selection · Stochastic Optimisation · Statistical 
Modelling · Experimental Design · Dimensionality Reduction · scikit-learn · 
High-Dimensional Data
